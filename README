History
=======

 2010-07-21: Initial import

    * Added IOobject support for automatic output - IOEquationReader
    * Removed need for pointers
    * Added support for scalarLists as a data source
    * Cleaned up available functions
 2010-10-16:
    * Added full support for fields - equationReader can now operate across the
        entire mesh.
    * Bug fixes:
        * Dimension-checking for min and max functions
        * Moved IOobjects to db directory
 2012-10-25:
